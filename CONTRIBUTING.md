## Style Guidelines

### TypeScript/JavaScript
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing ESLint configuration
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

### React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper TypeScript types for props
- Follow the existing component structure

### Convex Functions
- Keep functions pure when possible
- Handle errors appropriately
- Add proper TypeScript types
- Document complex logic

### Git Commit Messages
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

## Testing

- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Write integration tests for API endpoints
- Test error cases, not just happy paths
- Aim for high test coverage but focus on critical paths

## Documentation

- Update the README.md if you change functionality
- Update inline documentation for code changes
- Add JSDoc comments for new functions
- Update the API documentation if you change endpoints
